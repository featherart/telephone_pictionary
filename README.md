This is an online game of telephone pictionary.

The game is played with a large group of people by invitation. The initial player writes a phrase then invites a group of up to 20 people to play by email.

At least 6 people need to participate for a full game.

After the initial phrase is sent out, the next responder will draw an image that represents the phrase. The image will be sent to the next responder, who will write a phrase corresponding to the image. This will go on until the last person has played. Then the whole story composed of images and phrases will be revealed to all participants.
